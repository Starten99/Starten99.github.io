                The Tula region presented its gastronomic brands in a "clear glade" within the framework of the federal project "Gastronomic Map of Russia".<br>
                Gastronomic brands of the Tula region were presented on August 17, 2017 in the territory of the museum-estate of L.N. Tolstoy to the participants of the expedition "South" of the federal project "The Gastronomic Map of Russia".<br>
                The Tula region presented the "People's Table" in the concept of "Tula Tea Party" with the main symbols known all over the country and abroad - Tula samovars, Tula gingerbread, Belevian pastille, sugar heads. A special treat at the feast was a dish prepared according to the recipes of the writer's wife Sophia Tolstoy - An Ankovsky Pie (or Anka Pie), as well as old dishes from the Tula cuisine - the Buninsky Garden cake and pies from the nettle. Young, but already popular gastronomic brands - Suvorov sweets, birch kvass, Venovki rolls, Belevsky marmalade, Belevian marshmallow, berry tea and much more were also represented on the "public table" of the Tula region.<br>
